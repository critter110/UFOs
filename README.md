# UFOs
For this project we were given a js file that contained many instances of UFO sightings around the world in the form of an array. We were tasked with creating a website to display this data aesthetically in the form of a table and give users the ability to filter the sightings based on date, city, state, country, and shape. To do this, we created the app.js file to help upload the data onto our index.html file which creates the website. The first step is  writing a function to create the table and then loop through the raw data and append each instance to the table. Then, another function was written in order to take user input and filter the data. Finally, another function was written to take the filters, apply them to the raw data, and build the table with the filtered data for the website. 

To actually build the website, we used bootstrap for its stylistic properties. We gave the website a navigation bar and a big header with a background picture. Underneath that, we added a news article title and a couple of paragraphs about UFO sightings. Then underneath that, we displayed the table of data and filtering options with a button to execute the desired filters. Some of bootstraps stylistic options were used to change the background color and font color to make the website more aesthetically pleasing.
